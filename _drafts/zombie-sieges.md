title: "Zombie Sieges and the Defense Thereof"
---

Zombie siege starts at midnight (12000) in villages with more than 10 beds
or more than 20 villagers.

The village center is the location of the bell, if there is no bell it is the bed of the
leader.  Village size is at least 32 blocks out in each direction.

During the siege, normal spawning rules for zombies are relaxed, see wiki for details.

But the location of the spawn is chosen at random on a circle 0.9 the village radius, in a 16x6x16 box.
For a small village this means that a fence with radius 20 will keep the siegers out.  Otherwise: have the bell at the highest point of the village.
