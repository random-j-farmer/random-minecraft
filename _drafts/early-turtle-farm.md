## Hatching

Turtle eggs only hatch on sand or red sand.  Low chance to crack during a random tick throughout
the day.  Guaranteed to crack when receiving a random tick between 21600 and 22550 ticks (3:36 to
4:33 am, 48 seconds).  On average, it will take 4-5 nights for an egg to hatch.

Eggs do not progress if the player is not withing 128 blocks - it must receive random ticks.


Growing up: 20 minutes

# Random Ticks

Entity processing chunks with a distance of 128 or less from a player to its center receive
a chunk tick.  In every subchunk of the chunk, a number of blocks receive a random tick
(randomTickSpeed, 3 by default).  Median time between ticks 47.30 seconds.
