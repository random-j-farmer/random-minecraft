* Auto-Crafting: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJTeOBo6fMk , also Gnembon video
* Bamboo Farm Dimensions:  full hopper minecart into hopper 2.13 min,
  double speed 1.06 min.  so 3 pickups vs 5 pickups until items despawn,
  which is 64m long vs 106m.  So: up to 64 blocks hopper speed,
  up to 128 hopper speed at either end, up to 212 double hopper speed at either end.
  Note: hopper should lead to buffer storage e.h. barrel. 64 long bamboo field,
  22 wide, 21k items in full harvest (6 double chests) will taken 2.3 hours
  if single hopper line is used for the combined output. Bamboo growth:
  every 4096 game ticks on average, approx 50 minutes (note they don't all grow
  to 16 blocks, it's 12-16 actually). so length around 45 m for double speed line,
  above that use water streams.
