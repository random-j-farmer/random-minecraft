title: "Early Game Iron Farm"
---

There are a lot of videos on youtube about "Easy Starter Iron Farms", but to me they
mostly miss the point.  The building of the farms is not really the problem,
the problem is getting the villagers in, and the big problem is getting the zombie
in.

And more times than not, that part is elegantly skipped.

To me, the important bit is that you build your early game farm close to the ground.
So no pillaring up 20 odd blocks, that just makes it harder to put the villagers in
(and the zombie, oooh oooh, the zombie).

I usually put the villagers 6 blocks up from the ground, that is just enough that
the iron golems will not spawn on the ground.  And I've built it lower, iron golem
spawn range is easily controlled - it's just 8 blocks in every compass direction
(simplified but true) and 6 blocks up or down from the villagers positions.

The actual design of the farm is seconary to me.  They all tend to work at
similiar rates.

But I do have a preference, and it is this one: [Easier Iron Farm (1.14.4)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3I2jsINPGro)

Obviously, you don't need the workstations anymore but other than that, it still works fine.
And it has a couple of advantages that I miss about the simplified 1.15+ designs:

* The villagers are not standing on their beds, so if the farms stops working because
  a bed bugged out, you just wait for day when they are standing and destroy and
  place the bed again.
* The spawning pad on top means that a replacement zombie will not be ganked on the ground
  by iron golems, just put rails or redstone dust on any steps leading up the the zombie position.

Only change that is necessary for me: 2 glass blocks above each bed, and skip the workstations.
I build temporary stairs to the villager positions and let them go to sleep, than place those
glass blocks and destroy the stairway.

The zombie: it is possible to just lure it up a spawn-proofed stairway, and get it into a minecart.
But skeletons will try shoot you off the stairs, and creepers will try to sneak up while you are
watching the zombie.

I prefer luring the zombie into a trap with a roof, then go to sleep and get the zombie into
position during the day.  But that is it's own blog post.
